/**
 * Implementation for [AuditLogEntry][net.dv8tion.jda.api.audit.AuditLogEntry]
 * and all utilities needed for its structure.
 * To retrieve entries use the [AuditLogPaginationAction][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.restaction.pagination.AuditLogPaginationAction]
 * which can be retrieved from any [Guild][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Guild] instance
 * through [Guild.retrieveAuditLogs()][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Guild.retrieveAuditLogs].
 *
 *
 * Each Entry contains a set of [AuditLogChanges][net.dv8tion.jda.api.audit.AuditLogChange].
 * <br></br>To identify what kind of entry is represented use [ActionType][net.dv8tion.jda.api.audit.ActionType]!
