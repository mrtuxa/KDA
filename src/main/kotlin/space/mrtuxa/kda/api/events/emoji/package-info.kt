/**
 * Events that track [added emojis][net.dv8tion.jda.api.events.emoji.EmojiAddedEvent]
 * and [removed emojis][net.dv8tion.jda.api.events.emoji.EmojiRemovedEvent].
 * <br></br>Important to remember that [Custom Emojis][net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.emoji.RichCustomEmoji] are not the same as unicode emoji!
 *
 *
 * **Requirements**<br></br>
 *
 *
 * These events require the [EMOJI][net.dv8tion.jda.api.utils.cache.CacheFlag.EMOJI] CacheFlag to be enabled, which requires
 * the [GUILD_EMOJIS_AND_STICKERS][net.dv8tion.jda.api.requests.GatewayIntent.GUILD_EMOJIS_AND_STICKERS] intent.
 *
 * <br></br>[createLight(String)][net.dv8tion.jda.api.JDABuilder.createLight] disables that CacheFlag by default!
